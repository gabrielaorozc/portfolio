        <div class="subheading mb-3">Freelance & Personal Projects</div>
        <p>Since late 2024, I have been actively expanding my front-end and full-stack skills through 
          freelance work, personal projects, and continuous learning. I developed a Vue.js-based 
          portfolio website to showcase my experience and technical abilities, while also building 
          side projects in both Vue and React to deepen my understanding of component design, API 
          integration, and responsive UI/UX.
          One of my key projects is a task management application inspired by Agile tools like Jira, 
          featuring user authentication, dynamic task status columns, and a full-stack architecture 
          using React, Next.js, and MongoDB. Alongside project work, I continue to invest in advanced 
          front-end courses to stay current with modern JavaScript, performance optimization, and 
          evolving development best practices.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Ruffalo Noel Levitz</div>
        <p>At Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL), I led the front-end development of the RNL Management platform, 
          implementing robust login/logout flows, role-based access controls, and dynamic organizational 
          dashboards. I developed and maintained seamless RESTful API integrations to ensure reliable, 
          secure communication between the front end and back end, while optimizing data handling for 
          a smooth user experience. I also created highly interactive, accessible UI components using 
          Vue.js and TypeScript, including editable forms, tables, and real-time user management features. 
          Collaborating closely with AI engineers and cross-functional teams in an Agile environment, 
          I helped deliver polished, scalable, and AI-integrated tools that enhanced internal operations 
          and supported rapid feature development.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">VenueNext by Shift4</div>
        <p>At VenueNext by Shift4, I played a key role in revamping and modernizing multiple 
          front-end products, including the company's POS system and internal operations tool, Oz3.
          I co-developed Oz3 from the ground up using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and Material-UI, 
          collaborating closely with infrastructure engineers to build a scalable and efficient platform. 
          I also led critical UI refactors, breaking down large legacy components into smaller, 
          maintainable units aligned with single-responsibility principles. Throughout my time, I 
          consistently delivered pixel-perfect interfaces based on Figma designs, optimized user workflows, 
          resolved urgent post-release bugs, and participated in Agile ceremonies to ensure rapid, 
          high-quality software releases.</p>
